# SIP-order
Using existing time-series did the SIP order work in New York.


# About this Repository
This repository was created to store the markdown notebook and data sets created for a JAMA research note using basic time sereies data.  The data was downloaded from the NY-times dataset and then analyzed for (i) exponetial growth, (ii) overlay of teh 10 days around the SIP-order, siipping 5 days for population adaptation and 10 days after and (iii) difference model with linear modeling to determine the effect.  In addition a Granger causality test was done to see if the delayed incumbation time affected the numbers of cases after the SIP order.

# Free and Open for all to use

Ultimately the goal of this and other notebooks around the COVID-19 pandemic are meant to be used by all to halp provide predicitive models to determine best practices for public health.
